With inexpensive GPUs in the cloud, there isn't much of a need to spend thousands of dollars on a fully-loaded machine with a local GPU. That being said, having such a machine handy does not hurt.

I'm fortunate enough to be able to develop on a [Dell Precision 7520](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/precision-7520/spd/precision-15-7520-laptop) with an i7 CPU @ 2.9GHz, 32GB of RAM and a SSD. Most importantly, it has a [Nvidia M2200 GPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpudb/2922/quadro-m2200-mobile). It's not a [Titan Xp](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/10series/titan-xp/), but after loading up CUDA, cuDNN and Tensorflow 1.3, I'm finding it performs about 11% faster than a [EC2 g2.2xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-g2-instance-type-with-4x-more-gpu-power/).

Under no circumstances am I suggesting anyone drop $3k on a rig, but if it's there then running small tests locally is pretty convenient.
